File   : CHANGELOG.txt
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.3
- NEW: Added additional logging for errors returned by 'closedir', 'fflush', 'fclose'
- NEW: Additional changes made to facilitate 'dual transport' support.
- CHG: Property 'PROP_COMM_HOST' no longer uses 'localhost' as a default.  Also, if 
       this property remains undefined during deployment, no events will be queued.
- CHG: When Geozone arrival/departure 'delay' is in effect, the generated event will
       be the time and GPS fix of the moment that the geozone boundary crossing was
       detected.

Version 1.2.2
- NEW: Added support for reading NMEA-0183 data from external socket port 1155.
- NEW: Added checking for 'malloc' errors.
- CHG: Minor changes/additions made to OBC support fields.

Version 1.2.1
- CHG: Improved checking/settng default device id (now attempts to derive a default
       device id from the serial number, if a specific device id has not been 
       defined).
- CHG: Replaced all occurances of 'utcSleepMS' with 'threadSleepMS'.
- CHG: Minor changes/additions made to OBC support fields.
- NEW: Added new custom event field 'FIELD_ODOMETER'
- FIX: Changed fletcher checksum length to a fixed value of '2' (protocol.c), rather 
       than using "sizeof(ChecksumFletcher_t)", which is compiler/platform dependent.  
       (Thanks to Tomasz Rostanski for finding this!).
- FIX: Increased size of 'heBuf' buffer in call to 'gethostbyname_r' (sockets.c).
       (Thanks to Tomasz Rostanski for finding this!).

Version 1.2.0
- NEW: Significant changes have been made to facilitate porting to other platforms.
- NEW: Initial porting efforts to WindowsCE have been made. Included in this release
       is support for the new HP hw6945 phone which has an internal GPS receiver.
- NEW: Many new properties have been added (see 'props.h').
- NEW: New status codes have been added (see 'statcode.h').
- NEW: 'utcSetTimeSec'/'utcGetTimeSec' have now been modified to set/get the
       corrected UTC time, even if 'ENABLE_SET_TIME' has not been defined.
- NEW: A new threaded logging facility has been implemented.  Previously, a thread
       issuing a log message would block until the message was written to a file
       or the console.  The writing of log messages to auxiliary storage (or the
       console) is now left to the logging thread, allowing the task thread to
       immediately continue exiecuting.
- NEW: The protocol handler (protocol.c) can now handle multiple 'virtual' protocol
       'instances', allowing more than one transport to be attached to the device
       simultaneously (for monitoring, configuration, etc).
- CHG: The odometer unit of measurement has changed from 0.1 meters to 1 meters
       for the following properties:
           PROP_GPS_ACCURACY, PROP_GPS_DISTANCE_DELTA, 
           PROP_ODOMETER_#_VALUE, PROP_ODOMETER_#_LIMIT
       A 0.1 meter resolution did not provide a high enough top-end value that
       could be represented in 4 bytes.  The change to 1 meter units provides a
       maximum odometers value increase from about 267K miles (which many vehicles
       have been able to attain) to about 2.67M miles (we'll beyond the life 
       expectancey of most vehicles).  And 1 meter resolution is more than enough
       to provide a very accurate GPS calculated odometer reading (at least well
       within the accuracy of currently available GPS receivers).  Note that this
       does not effect the resolution of the reported 'distance' field in the
       event packets, which is still reported in kilometers.  The odometer module 
       has been updated to accomodate this resolution change.
- CHG: Modified the 'pipe' support (used for comport emulation) in "comport.c" to 
       open the client/server pipes in the proper order to prevent potential
       dead-lock (for Linux/Cygwin targets only).
- CHG: PROP_CFG_GPS_MODEL moved from 0xEF22 to 0xEF2A.  This was done to allow
       other serial port configurations for 0xEFX2 through 0xEFX9.
- CHG: Renamed "src/tools/socket.[ch]" to "src/tools/sockets.[ch]"
- CHG: PROP_COMM_APN_SETTINGS moved from 0xF3AA to 0xF3AC.
- CHG: The elapsed time unit of measurement has changed from milliseconds to
       seconds for the properties PROP_ELAPSED_#_LIMIT.  This allows the elapsed
       time seconds to be stored in a single 32-bit integer.
- CHG: Removed support for non-'malloc'ed event queues (all current reference 
       implementation platforms support 'malloc').
- CHG: 'ENABLE_ODOMETER' compile-time var was removed and odometer support was made 
       part of the the standard configuration.
- FIX: Fixed sample server function "uploadSendFile" to properly send binary files.

Version 1.1.8
- CHG: Updated the protocol version property (in 'propman.c') to correctly reflect
       the change/correction to the protocol specification.
- NEW: Q&A/FAQ added to README.txt

Version 1.1.7
- CHG: Relaxed communication property values for Socket communications. Added
       the config file "debug.conf" to unrestrict all communication settings for
       use while debug/testing.
- CHG: Removed uneeded debug messages in geozone testing.
- CHG: Added compile time tests for multiple TRANSPORT_MEDIA_ definitions.
- NEW: Added additional GPS parsing to support $GPGSA sentences.

Version 1.1.6
- NEW: Client now sends 'STATUS_INITIALIZED' event on first GPS fix after startup.
- NEW: Full featured scalable Geofence/GeoZone arrival departure event generation.
- CHG: Code refactoring to allow for easier customization.
- DEL: The OpenDMTP protocol specification document has been removed from this
       package and moved to its own downloadable package (see the OpenDMTP Protocol
       Specification).

Version 1.1.5
- CHG: Reduced/Relaxed the "Connection Accounting" defaults in 'propman.c'.
- NEW: Added status codes "STATUS_INITIALIZED" and "STATUS_WAYMARK" to the OpenDMTP 
       protocol.
- CHG: Minor documentation changes.

Version 1.1.4
- BUG: Fixed bug where Longitude was not encoded/decoded properly in the Eastern 
       Hemishpere.  The fix means that longitude values still encoded with prior
       versions of the C-client will not be parsable with this or subsequent
       versions.  Make sure all prior cached OpenDMTP packets are parsed before
       moving to this version (ie. all longitude values have been decoded into
       their decimal format).
- CHG: Minor documentation changes.

Version 1.1.3
- NEW: 'parsfile' now supports GPX output format.
- NEW: Improved GPS fix "stale" checking.  Client now sends ERROR_GPS_EXPIRED, or
       ERROR_GPS_FAILURE, if client hasn't received a valid GPS fix in awhile.
- NEW: When the sample server receives either ERROR_GPS_EXPIRED/ERROR_GPS_FAILURE, 
       it will request the PROP_STATE_GPS_DIAGNOSTIC property.
- NEW: Added in-motion/stop-motion event generation feature to allow specifying an
       option to generate in-motion events only if actually moving, and generate
       a stop-motion event with the time the stop actually occurred.
- NEW: Now includes sample serial port server.
- CHG: Saved state is now written to a separate properties 'state' file, instead
       of back to the same properties config file.
- BUG: 'parsfile' incorrectly listed "code" field heading in first CSV column.

Version 1.1.2
- NEW: Updated 'sockserv' to support writing files in CSV format.
- NEW: Included "webserve/track.html" as a template for creating web-based GPS 
       tracking.
- CHG: Modified 'parsfile' to move data/time fields to beginning of CSV record.

Version 1.1.1
- NEW: Added support for recognizing 'ttyUSB#' serial devices
- CHG: "custom/startup.c" option '-debug' now outputs to console (was syslog)
- CHG: Changed property manager to save properties with key-name reference rather
       than the key-id (see "base/propman.c"). Also changed file-loaded properties
       to be marked with KVA_NONDEFAULT attribute (so they'll be saved properly).
- CHG: Change Linux default make 'dest' to 'linux' (was 'gumstix').
- BUG: "README.txt" incorrectly referenced make target 'server' instead of 'sockserv'
- BUG: "custom/startup.c" incorrectly referenced compile-time var 
       'TRANSPORT_MEDIA_SOCK' instead of 'TRANSPORT_MEDIA_SOCKET'.

Version 1.1.0
- NEW: Added new PKT_SERVER_FILE_UPLOAD packet to support client file uploading.
- NEW: Added support for GPRS modem transport media (TRANSPORT_MEDIA_GPRS).
- NEW: Added PROP_GEOF_ARRIVE_DELAY/PROP_GEOF_DEPART_DELAY properties
- NEW: Added a simple geofence arrival/departure GPS rule module
- NEW: Included version 0.0.1 of the OpenDMTP protocol definition manual.
- CHG: Changed property keyname strings ('base/propman.c')
- CHG: Renamed sample socket 'server' to 'sockserv'.
- CHG: Additions/changes to client error codes in 'base/cerrors.h'
- CHG: Changed 'parsfile' CSV output record format.

Version 1.0.4
- NEW: Added build documentation for GumStix platform.
- NEW: Added syslog support for Linux/GumStix
- CHG: Added additional code documentation.
- CHG: Threads/Malloc enabled by default (in 'Makefile').
- BUG: Fixed Linux socket read timeout issue in example 'server'.

Version 1.0.3
- NEW: First public release
